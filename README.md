## environment
Every year, environmental problems caused by clothing production and disposal are intensifying.
Moreover, it can be seen that a culture in which the cycle of clothing consumption is very short these days is taking place.
Our service avoids this type of consumption.
Rather than buying new clothes every time, I borrow the clothes I need and borrow the clothes I thought I'd throw away to protect the environment
In addition, it gives responsibility for consumption and production.
## Excessive Consumption
This webpage was developed to avoid overconsumption of clothing by the 2030 generation in Korea and to encourage reasonable consumption.
On this webpage, you can rent and share clothes with each other in the area you want in Seoul through Google Maps.
